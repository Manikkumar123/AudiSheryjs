So here are the steps to download it on your own pc and have fun.....

To quickly use Shery.js, include the following CDN link in your HTML file:
```html just above your style.css file
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/sheryjs/dist/Shery.css" />
```

Then, import it in your JavaScript file:
```js just above body tag
<script  type="text/javascript"  src="https://unpkg.com/sheryjs/dist/Shery.js"></script> 
```
### 2. Required Libraries
To successfully run with CDN, you'll need some libraries.
``` copy all these libraries to your html just where you attached the script js file, btw copying all these files is not needed for the above mentioned effect but still you can do it for now.
